# ModerateBuildingStock: 
This is the repository to create synthetic time-series building operational data for the MODERATE Horizon EU project. 
The files in this repository are reqired to run time-series simulations using EnergyPlus models. The EnergyPlus models use IDF as inputs; these inputs have been determined using national/regional building stock cluster data (obtained from WP3). There are also two jupyter notebooks demonstrating the use of EnergyPlus within a Python Environment. 

Description of files are as follow:
1. BrusselsIWEC.epw: EnergyPlus weather file required for simulation in E+UseCase.ipynb.
2. E+UseCase.ipynb: Use this notebook to run your first E+ simulation (Dependencies:
